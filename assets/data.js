      summary: `Quantifies how long it takes to detect when reservoir water-supply reliability and flood performance deviate beyond natural variability, under uncertain climate and land-use change. Attributes detection timing to key drivers and uses a logistic-regression classifier to predict future detections from recent observations.`
